1. Always document a module

2. Even when there's no documentation to leave, use documentation property with false boolean value, like @moduledoc false

3. When referring to functions, use backticks to specify `function/1`

4. In between docs and functions, leave a newline

5. Use markdown in docs

6. Include examples as many as possible
